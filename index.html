                    Arstotzka and Kolechia came out of the Six-Year War shortly before September
                    1982 and relations between the two countries remain somewhat volatile.

                    A particularly heated subject is the status of
                    the city of Grestin, a border town divided into East Grestin, which is under Arstotzkan
                    jurisdiction, and West Grestin, which is part of Kolechia. Crossing the border between the two
                    halves had been impossible, even for Arstotzkan citizens, until November 23rd, 1982 when
                    Arstotzka opened a checkpoint to allow entry from Kolechia.
